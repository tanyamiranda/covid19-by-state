## CDC TERMINATES TRACKING IN MAY OF 2023

<p>The CDC stopped keeping track of some COVID data collections in April and May of 2023. As a result, I have updated the code to fetch only data up to 5/1/2023 to keep the charts in sync and so that charts are not empty or blank for more recent queries. I also removed the option to query recent data. All data ends in 2023.</p> 

<p>These updates were made in April of 2024</p>
